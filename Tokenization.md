## PCI DSS: Scope Minimization via Tokenization

**PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** aims to protect cardholder data and reduce the risk of data breaches. One effective method for minimizing the scope of PCI DSS compliance is **tokenization**.

### What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of replacing sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, with unique identification symbols (tokens) that retain all essential information without compromising security. These tokens can be used in place of actual card data in transactions, reducing the amount of sensitive data stored and processed.

### Benefits of Tokenization for PCI DSS Scope Minimization

1. **Reduced Risk**: By storing tokens instead of actual card data, the risk of data breaches is significantly lowered.
2. **Simplified Compliance**: Tokenization reduces the scope of PCI DSS requirements, making compliance easier and less costly.
3. **Enhanced Security**: Tokens are meaningless if intercepted, providing an additional layer of security.

### Implementation

To implement tokenization:
1. **Choose a Tokenization Provider**: Select a reputable provider that offers robust tokenization services.
2. **Integrate Tokenization**: Integrate the tokenization service into your payment processing system.
3. **Update Policies**: Ensure your security policies and procedures reflect the use of tokenization.

# Tokenization with self cleanup

## Project
    'TimedScopeMinimizedTokenizationDemo'

## **How It Works:**

1. **Service Initialization**: When the application starts, the `TokenCleanupService` is initialized.
2. **Scheduled Cleanup**: The `StartAsync` method sets the timer to run the cleanup task every hour.
3. **Token Cleanup**: The `CleanupTokens` method periodically removes expired tokens from the token store.
4. **Service Shutdown**: When the application stops, the `StopAsync` method stops the timer.

By implementing and engaging the `TokenCleanupService`, you ensure that expired tokens are regularly cleaned up, preventing the token store from building up and consuming excessive memory.
